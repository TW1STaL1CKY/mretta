## Mretta

A Fretta-like minigame framework base built for Meta, built from scratch.

----

### What is Mretta?

Built from scratch by myself (@TW1STaL1CKY), Mretta is a framework for easy minigame gamemode creation and hosting. Made for, and intended, to be used by Metastruct.

It contains pre-made gamemode elements (complete with hooks) so you don't need to worry about building it all yourself,
and it includes helper functions to help you flesh out your minigame faster and easier.
<br>These include:
- Rounds and round timer system
- RTV and end-of-game voting system
- Custom music & sound effects utility library
- Pre-built HUD that is able to be replaced if need be
- On-HUD alerts

### Can I make a minigame?

Sure, I encourage developers to make their own minigames for Mretta! I would like to have each new minigame reviewed before being used on Meta to ensure it works correctly with the base.

To create a Mretta minigame, create a new gamemode with *mretta_* prefixed in its name, and derive it off the *mretta_base* gamemode. Find more details on the FAQ.

### Can I contribute to the base?

I would rather be the sole maintainer for the base gamemode for the time being. I will take pull requests for fixes and other **small** contributions, however any bigger changes I will want to look into myself.
